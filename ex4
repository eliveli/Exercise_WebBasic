            Introduction
        </header>
        <p>
            Cascading Stylesheets — or <code>CSS</code> — is the first technology you should start learning after <code>HTML</code>.
            While HTML is used to define the structure and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style it and lay it
            out. For example, you can use CSS to alter the <code>font</code>, <code>color</code>, <code>size</code>, and
            spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.
        </p>

            Prerequisites
        </header>
        <p>
            You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS. We recommend that you work through our
            Introduction to HTML module first.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you learn further HTML and CSS at the same
            time, moving back and forth between the two topics. This is because HTML is far more interesting and much
            more fun to learn when you apply CSS, and you can't really learn CSS without knowing HTML.

            This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for working through them. You should
            definitely start with the first one.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>CSS first steps</li>
            <p>
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font,
                color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other
                decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the
                basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to
                HTML.
            </p>
            <li>CSS building blocks</li>
            <p>
                This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity with the language
                and its syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, its time to dive a bit deeper. This module
                looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling
                backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.
            </p>
            <p>
                The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the
                essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS layout.
            </p>
            <li>Styling text</li>
            <p>With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling text
                — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals, including
                setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows and other text features. We round
                off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.
            </p>
            <li>CSS layout</li>
            <p>
                At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and
                manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in
                the right place in relation to the viewport, and one another. We have covered the necessary
                prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern
                layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might still
                want to know about.

            Solving common CSS problems
        </header>
        <p>
            Use CSS to solve common problems provides links to sections of content explaining how to use CSS to solve
            very common problems when creating a web page.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the beginning, you'll primarily apply colors to HTML elements and their backgrounds; change the size,
            shape, and position of elements; and add and define borders on elements. But there's not much you can't do
            once you have a solid understanding of even the basics of CSS. One of the best things about learning CSS is
            that once you know the fundamentals, usually you have a pretty good feel for what can and can't be done,
            even if you don't actually know how to do it yet!
